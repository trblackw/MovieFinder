# MovieFinder
React application built for viewing movie data via The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It incorporates redux for state management, and is built using Parcel. 

To view:
1) Git clone https://github.com/trblackw/MovieFinder.git
2) cd MovieFinder
3) npm run dev

It's a work in progress, as I learn both react and redux best practices, but I'd very much welcome any PRs or feedback.
